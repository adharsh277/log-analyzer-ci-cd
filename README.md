## 📌 Project Overview

This project showcases a fully automated **log analysis and reporting system** using modern DevOps practices.

- 📜 Parses structured web server logs
- 📊 Generates analytics report (CSV & Graph)
- ⚙️ Automates analysis with GitHub Actions CI/CD
- 🐳 Dockerized Python application
- 🔁 Workflow runs on every code or log update

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time log parsing and summary reporting
- ✅ Error trend visualization (line chart)
- ✅ Auto CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- ✅ Docker-based reproducibility
- ✅ Structured codebase with modular design

## 🧪 How It Works

### 📝 Log Format (Apache-style)

27.0.0.1 - - [16/Jul/2025:10:00:01 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1024



### 🔍 Analyzer Functions

- Extracts: IP, Time, Method, Endpoint, Status Code, Response Size
- Summarizes:
  - Total Requests
  - Error Counts (4xx & 5xx)
  - Error Rate (%)
- Visualizes: Errors over time (HH:MM)

  
## ⚙️ CI/CD Workflow

### 📥 On Push to `main`, GitHub Actions:

1. 📦 **Checks out repo**
2. 🐍 **Installs dependencies**
3. 🧪 **Runs log analyzer**
4. 📁 **Uploads summary and chart as artifacts**

> Trigger Paths:
``yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
